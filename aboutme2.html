          Hi, my name is Samuel Eun, my friends call me Sam. As you can tell from the website, I love basketball. Basketball, basketball, basketball.
          I am a 6'1 (as of the winter of 2017) center. I also am a slight sneakerhead. I love lebrons for their proformance. For stunting and style 
          I like jordans. For causal wear, I might start to look into addias. My favorite color is red. My favorite color combination is red/black 
          aka "bred" in the shoe industry. My second favorite color combination is light blue/white, which is displayed on this website. My favorite 
          number is 11 or 29. 11 because it makes you look taller if on a jersy... also its concidentally Yao Ming's number. 29 because, call me 
          obsesed, its Lebron James' jersy numbers, 23 and 6, combined. My favorite food is pizza, but sadly I refrain from drowning myself in pizza 
          because I am working out. If I wasnt health conscience, I would be broke from eating pizza.

          I have 3 hobbies: playing basketball, working out, and listening to music. My role model is Lebron James (above). He is a small forward in 
          the Cleveland Cavaliers number 23. His explosiveness is my favorite trait that I am currently working to achieve. Lebron explodes into the 
          paint and explodes up into a dunk like nothing. Ball is life. For basketball, I workout. I got a pass at one of the most expensive gyms in 
          LA. There, I train my arms, chest, and core. At home, I preform advanced plyometrics so that I can jump higher. I hope to dunk on a 10 feet 
          rim by January 26th, which is a basketball event at my school called midnight madness. I drink 2 protein shakes a day and get in from 2000 
          through 2500 depending if I am cutting or bulking. I get in the most protein I can in a day which ranges from 100 grams to 150 grams. I love 
          listeing to music. My favorite artist are Khalid, Quavo, and Logic. They make great songs that hype me anythime of the day.
