        My name is Samuel Eun. I was born on Januray first. I have 3 hobbies: playing basketball, working out, and listening to music. My role model is Lebron James (above). He is a small forward in the Cleveland Cavaliers number 23. His explosiveness is my favorite trait that I am currently working to achieve. Lebron explodes into the paint and explodes up into a dunk like nothing. Ball is life. For basketball, I also workout. I got a pass at one of the most expensive gyms in LA. There, I train my arms, chest, and core. At home, I preform advanced plyometrics so that I can jump higher. I hope to dunk on a 10 feet rim by January 26th, which is a basketball event at my school called midnight madness. I drink a 2 protein drinks a day and get in from 2000 through 2500 depending if I am cutting or bulking. I get in the most protein I can in a day which ranges from 100 grams to 150 grams. I love listeing to music. My favorite artist are Khalid, Quavo, and Logic. They make great songs that hype me anythime of the day.
