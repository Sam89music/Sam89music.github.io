        My name is Samuel Eun. I was born on Januray first, yes, New Years Day. I have 3 hobbies: playing guitar, listening to music, and skating. I haved played the guitar for 6 years now and I would like to consider myself a pro. I have been in many conserts which failed me. My recent one turned off my guitar mic so only the few in the front seats could ear it. Whats funny is that that was the only consert that ive been in that hired a sound engineer. I have recently started skating and I got quickly attached. Although I can only do one trick, ollie, I am addicted to skating. Once, I rode my skate in the rain, and two days later, when I had my phone on my hand I pushed my skateboard but the wheels didn't push, therefore I fell with my phone still in my hands, cracking the phone to the state I can see the insides. My favorite band is BTS from kpop. I recently got hooked to kpop and BTS. I started with the song "I Need You" and memorzied RapMonster's rap in that song. My favorite members in that band are V and RapMonster. Now I am memorizing RapMonster's part in two other songs. RapMonster (aka RapMon or Nam Joon) can only rap. I've heard him sing and it was horrible. V (aka TaeTae or Tae Hyung) is a vocalist of the band. He is the swag of the band. In the video below, Just One Day, RapMon is the one with white hair, and V is the one with orange hair. But don't memorize their names by their hair color because they change their hair color every few months.
